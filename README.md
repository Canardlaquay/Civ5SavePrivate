# Civ5SavePrivate

Almost 5 years that the game is out and we still can't make a lobby private when you load a save.

1) Download here
2) Run it
3) Open file
4) Toggle public/private
5) Save/overwrite file 


Linux/MacOSX users: Here's the code in C to make it private https://gist.github.com/baylej/d99d772162ba65c80157
